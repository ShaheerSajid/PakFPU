# Pakfpu

A FPU developed at IC Design Lab in NUST for the community in Pakistan. The FPU is IEEE-754 compliant and verified using Berkely TestFloat. Pakfpu is implemented in systemverilog and is fully paramterizable supporting single, double and quad precision. 32 and 64bit integer formats are also supported.
